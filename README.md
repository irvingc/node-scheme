Scheme Interpreter in JS
========================

This is a TOY implementation of Scheme, started as a small university project. Hence it is incomplete and a work in progress.

Installation
------------

Execute the following command:

	npm install node-scheme

If you have the code, or the tarball, execute:

	npm install

Inside the extracted directory.

Usage
-----

Run the following you installed through bare npm

	node-scheme

if you have downloaded the code you can run:

	./bin/scheme

inside the code directory


File Structure
--------------

	bin/scheme		The naked file which allows for naked execution
	lib/			Supporting javascript for scheme
	lib/definitions.js	Definitions used by all scheme js files
	lib/scheme.js		The meat of the scheme implementation
	lib/util.js		Helper utility functions
	lib/grammar.js		This file is autogenerated by the JS/CC grammar
	grammar/grammar.par	The scheme definition in JS/CC


Testing
-------

The files inside test can be run with:

	npm test

Project Structure
-----------------

Jake runs the lifecycle for the project. When you call `npm install` it will run the JS/CC compiler through jake. JS/CC will generate the grammar.js file, which is the main driver for the scheme implementation.
